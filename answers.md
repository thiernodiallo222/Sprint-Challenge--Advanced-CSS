1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An adaptive website is one that scalls in respect of the size of the screen. For example, if the in a desktop screen, it adapts to the website size and to the mobile view, it scalls down to adapte to the mobile view, but keeping the same layout.
In the other hand, a fully resonsive website is one that have all the specifications of an adaptive website, plus the ability to adapte its layout to the new screen size for a better readability.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
mobile first design is a meant to start desiging our website keeping in our mind that the first layout is for mobile devices and then, move on for bigger screens such as tablets and desktop. Desktop first design, in contrast, is the opposite of mobile first design, meaning that we start our design with in mind, the desktop layout first, then, move on to smaller screens such as tablets and mobile phones.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
The default browser setting for the font-size is 16px. To make it easier for programmers to express the font size in rem with easier computation, the html font-size has been reset to 62.5%, which is equivalent to 10px, and the fact of expressing it to % helps to scall up and down. Then 1 rem = 10px.


4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing a technic that helps make the programmers life easier, by the assistance of a preprocessor such as less or sass. Then, instead of writting code directly inside the css file, we just need to ddowload required applications, set up the preprocessor, and then write the code directly in the preprocessor file which translates code directly into css in the css file, that the browser is able to understand.


5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite concept in preprocessing is the fact of nesting css selectors the same way as they are nested in the html file. That helps find conresponding files much easier. Maybe the multiple less files is what seems to be a bit challenging.
